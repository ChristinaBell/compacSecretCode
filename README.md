# Christina & Abby | Part IV Project

## A serverless, cloud-based interface for the monitoring of global machine performance

###Description:
To explore state-of-the-art cloud architectures and visualisation tools and deliver a proof-of-concept for a tool that Compac’s global service team can use to monitor our customers’ machine performance in near-real-time.
The project will use the latest cloud programming concepts to deliver a serverless interface to real machine performance data from Compac’s world-class Inspection platform, Spectrim. The target user is Compac’s service team, who will be able to log in, view packhouse performance, compare performance across different packhouses, and receive notifications when performance is consistently poor.


###Outcome:
On top of the academic outputs of the report, which will remain the top priority for the students, the source code for a working proof of concept software package shall be deliverable to Compac. This will be used as a proof of concept to generate interest and act as a tool to unlock subsequent further investment by Compac in this area.
